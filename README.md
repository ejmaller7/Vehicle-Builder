  ## Description
  This allows the user to build a vehicle based on the prompts the user receives. The user will be given 3 different choices of what they would like theirr vehicle to be which are a car, truck or motorbike. Once the user has chosen one of the vehicles, they are then directed to a set of questions relating to the vehicle they have chosen. These questions range from color of the vehicle to top speed of the vehicle. Since the three vehicles are not the same, there are also specific prompts associated with both the truck and the motorbike which are towing capacity for the truck and various wheel questions for the motorbike. Once all of this is done, the actions are performed to create a vehicle.
